# One-Hit-Duel
### It is a game that two players must hit each other in order to win the round. But the catch is that every hit is lethal.
## Showcase of the idle, walking, jumping and falling animations and states.

## You have to charge your attack for at least 0.7 seconds for it to go off, otherwise it will be canceled. The maximum charging time is 2 seconds and the attack will go off after the timer, this prevents some abuse of waiting the perfect time when the enemy enters your hitbox range. You can also charge while in ground and air.

## You can also block your enemy attack, but you will move slower. I will probably add a stamina bar so you can't be invulnerable for the whole time.

## You have a special unblockable attack that will also kill the enemy in one hit. It will be unlocked when you succesfully hit a blocking enemy a few times.

# There's still plenty to do but i'm having fun working on this project. There's still a TON to learn.
